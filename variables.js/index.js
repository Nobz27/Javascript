// Variables allow storing data in memory for use in a program/software
// In js we create/initialize variables using var, const and let keywords

// var -- old/legacy way of creating variables
var age = 90

// let and const are modern/es6 ways of creating variables
let username = "albert"
const interestRate = 20

// let is used with values/variables that change as the program runs
// const is used for values/variables that do not change at any point in the life of a program/software eg PI
const PI = 3.142

// the values in variables can be access in the application using the variable names
//console.log(something) is a way for developers to print/see outcome on the terminal/console.
console.log(age)
console.log(PI + interestRate)
